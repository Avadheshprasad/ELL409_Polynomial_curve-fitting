# ELL409_Polynomial_curve-fitting
##Part-1
The objective here is to implement the concepts of regression learnt in class via polynomial curve fitting. To
recap, polynomial curve fitting is an example of regression. In regression, the objective is to learn a function that
maps an input variable x to a continuous target variable t.


##part-2
Here,we are provided with a second personalised data set, available at https://web.iitd.ac.in/Ëœsumeet/
A1/2019MT60747/non_gaussian.csv. It is generated from a different polynomial, and the noise is now nonGaussian. 
here we will figure out what kind of noise it is? Please justify your answer using appropriate analysis
